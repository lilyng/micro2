<button class="accordion" >How can I be more respectful to understand / learn about my peer and transition into a dicussion about issues were mutally interested in?</button>
<div class="panel" text-align="left">
  <p> It is important when building trust with another person is that we respect each other's confidentiality.   Pay attention to what is yours to share and what is not.  Start off by making sure you are acknowledging them and the topic you are about to dive into! Here's some sentence frames to keep in mind: </p> <br>
    <ul text-align="left">
      <li>"If it is ok with you, can I ask you more about _______________."</li>
      <br>
      <li>"I don't know much about this information, but I am wondering if I can ask you because I trust you..."</li>
      <br>
      <li>"I may make a mistake in the way I phrase this, but totally stop me if I do! ...."</li>
      <br>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Some people may be easily offended than others, how can I, or others, handle the situation?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <br> 
  <p>Find a way to pause from assuming or reacting right away.</p>
  <br><p>Always minimize aggressions. Anger is natural, it is even normal!   However, it is our choice whether we want to make the situation worse or react to the anger in a positive manner.</p> <br>  
  <br> <p>Assess the situation.   React in a way that does not heighten the situation. If it is the first time and the incident is new to you, you could ask the person to repeat what he/she said or did.</p>
  <br> <p>Also, ask yourself before rising the conversation into an argument, is this particular action worth my time and effort? What kind of risk will I be taking if I do this?</p>

<button class="accordion">Why is microaggresion something we should know and to handle if it happens to us or a peer?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Creating a community where it is safe and equal for all diversities involves us to build trust through careful listening, respectful disagreement, and risk taking.  
      <br>
      <br> <p>The goal here is education.  It is not about winning a point or making someone feel bad or wrong. It is about helping them understand something from a different perspective.</p>

</div>
 <button class="accordion">Micro means small, what difference do these "small" comments make?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Because they are micro, very subtle and small, some people feel like they don't have a reason to be upset, but really, those subtle offensive comments, unintentional discrimination can impact the persons' self-esteem and build up over time. </p>
    <br> 
    <br>
    <p>Here's a video by SheKnows. The video's mission is to educate viewers on the concept of microaggresions with the help of examples from teenagers featured here: </p>

 <br>
        <br> <p>
And heres one more video that shows a basic example of microaggresion with a person of color in the workplace:
        </p> <br>
        <br>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/06VgDapDP9M?rel=0&amp;start=169" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </p>
  </div>
<button class="accordion">How do I tell a person that their comment was not ok towards me but in a nice way?</button>
<div class="panel"><br>
  <p>While their intention was probably not the best, consider how you can change your response to overcome the microaggression.  The art of handling microaggresions effectively develops over time. </p>
<br>
<br>
     <p> There is no right way to respond but, reflect on what you heard, don't accuse, and explain your reaction to the comment before you might say "I know it wasn't your intent, but that made me uncomfortable" . </p>
