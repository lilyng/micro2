  <h1> HOW TO <i>be an Ally</i> </h1>

<button class="accordion">What is an ally?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p> Being an ally is more than being sympathetic towards those experiencing discrimination or just simply believing in equality. Allies support marginalized groups of people to ensure they are valued. This can entail speaking up for members of another
          group who are being treated unjustly through both intentional and unintentional actions from other people in pursuit of ending oppression and creating equality. </p> <br>

          AWARENESS AND EDUCATION <br>
          Not sure where to start? Try having conversations with individuals that you want to know more about or taking a self-inventory of your own values/experiences or simply conducting personal research. The more informed you are, the more confident you will feel in standing up in future situations where microaggressions occur.
          <br>
          <br>
          OPEN AND SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT <br>
          Treat every situation with respect. Listen actively with empathy when someone reaches out to you without judgement.
          <br>
          <br>
          ACTION <br> Using your own discretion of the situation context, speak up when you witness a microaggression. One recommended communication strategy is the OTFD approach (Open The Front Door). Observe: Concrete, factual, and observable (describe what you see clearly) Think: Thoughts
          based on observation (state your thoughts) Feel: Emotions (express your feelings). Desire: Specific request or inquiries about desired outcome. <br> Example: "I've noticed there's been lot of interruptions during our all-hands meeting. I feel uncomfortable that the new workers are not able to share their thoughts. Can we figure out some meeting discussion guidelines so everyone has a say and we can be more productive in future?"
          <br>
          <br> 
          MICROAFFIRMATIONS<br> Microaffirmations are small acts that promote inclusion, listening, and support for marginalized groups of people. In the workplace, this may entail acknowledging and commending the performance and achievements of workers.
